##Written Analysis for PyCity Schools

The number of students in a school has significant impact on whether students have both a passing math and reading score.  Also, whether the school is either a charter or district school seems to matter, too.\  

The median math and reading scores among all 15 scores are not dramatically different.  Median math scores are within 10 points and median reading scores are within 3 points.  Similarly, the averages for both scores are reasonably close as well.  However, it seems the bottom performing schools have far less kids that pass both tests, and that is reflected in the overall passing rate.\

Charter schools rank as top 8 performing schools in PyCity, and they generally spend less on each student.  More analysis into the specific factors that contribute to this outcome is needed.
